# What the hell does this do? Well, there aren't any games that actually use
# the mode button. Steam uses it to activate Big Picture Mode, but no game
# uses it. That's because it has system-level functionality on their original
# consoles that games cannot interfere with. So why not co-opt it for system-
# level functionality on our own "console", Linux?
#
# This only works if you have MG's virtual keyboard and mouse enabled.
# In addition, it only emits relevant keypresses; you'll need to make sure
# you have something that reacts to them.
